# Foundations of Design
Created this with team for a final Arduino project in my intro Engineering
course.  Simulated a flood detection system with a water sensor and a built
river device to wait for rising water levels to flow fast enough.

I couldn't find any photos of the final output, those are probably lost to
time, but I'll put what I still have here as reference.
